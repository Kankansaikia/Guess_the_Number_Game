# Guess the Number Game

## Project Description

This project is a simple command-line based "Guess the Number" game written in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the number. With each guess, the program provides feedback to help the player converge on the correct number. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, at which point the total number of attempts is displayed.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Execute the Python script to start the game.
2. **Make a Guess**: Input a number between 1 and 100 when prompted.
3. **Get Feedback**: After each guess, the program will tell you whether the target number is higher or lower than your guess.
4. **Repeat**: Continue guessing based on the feedback until you find the correct number.
5. **Win the Game**: The game ends when you guess the correct number, and it will display the number of attempts you made.

## Installation

To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
